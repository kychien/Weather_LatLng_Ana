# Weather Latitude Analysis
---
An exercise using  OpenWeatherMap API to "prove" that the closer you get to the equator, the hotter it gets.  Using citipy to find the closest city to (target_sample_size/.29) pairs of lat/lng coordinate pairs, in order to account for land to water ratio, use the maximum number of allowable calls on a free api_key from openweathermaps to pull weather data to plot to visualize patterns.
